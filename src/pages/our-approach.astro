        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-6">
          A classical education invites students to engage deeply with the core subjects that have shaped civilizations, from literature and history to logic, mathematics, and the natural sciences. Unlike modern curricula, a classical approach equips students with the critical thinking and communication skills necessary to navigate a complex world by taking a low-tech approach in the classroom.

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
          Rooted in the Lutheran heritage of grace, truth, and service, Christ Classical Academy will offer an educational experience that not only prepares students for academic success but nurtures their character, faith, and sense of purpose.

              We are striving to build a school that doesn’t water down education or faith. A school that honors the wisdom of the past while preparing children for the future. This school won’t chase modern trends but will instead form strong, capable young men and women grounded in truth. This school is built for families like yours.

              We recognize that children need to build foundational skills (i.e. motor, reading, self-regulation) before being ready to appropriately, effectively, and most importantly safely engage with technology. Our classrooms will not use 1-1 devices or iPads for classroom instruction or activities. When developmentally appropriate and enriching to the education experience, students will be taught how to navigate and appropriately use technology as a beneficial tool.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Work hard and play harder. We know that educational results and standards are not compromised by ample play time. For our elementary-aged kids, we are committed to 3 recesses a day: one in the morning, one after lunch, and one in the afternoon. When kids get the opportunity to move their bodies and play, we know they retain what they are learning better and can exhibit more self-control in the classroom.
